# H3p_Quantification
A common analysis pipeline for finding spots and worms from low resolution spinning disk data.  This is interactive:  with outlier elimination easily screened for by clicking on points in extraneous points in plotly, visualizing the corresponding image in napari, and allowing one to remove that point from further analysis.
